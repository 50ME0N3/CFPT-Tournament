# The bot
## General Information
The bot is a Discord bot that is used to manage the tournament. He's the main part of the project. It's the one who the users interact with. First you have to go on the [Discrod Developper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create the bot. On the bot page you have to check the `Presence intent`, `Server member intent` and `Message content intent`. Don't forget to save the token we will need it later.
## Configuration
You can configure the bot by editing the `/botTournois/config.json` file.
